Game project done at the Global Game Jam @ FIU Tech Center.

Theme was waves. Game is a single level first-person survival run where the player must make it to the end without touching an enemy. Enemy chases player. Visibility is limited with a waves of red light illuminating the level traveling through the level's models.
